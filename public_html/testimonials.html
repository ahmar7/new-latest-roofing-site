I’m a remote landlord and have had a particularly difficult time since a tenant did a ‘runner’ in August, leaving my property like a cess-pit and with the services cut-off. Bill has been driven to distraction helping me rectifying the problems left by the previous ‘agent’ who supposedly managed the house; in particular the exasperating time and effort he has had to spend dealing with a utility company who, for over three months, have been attempting to set a world record in bureaucratic incompetence. As well as repairing and redecorating the premises (what an insignificant statement that is!) he also found me a new tenant and will continue to ‘keep an eye’ on things in the future. Bill and I have chatted often on the phone resolving one unexpected issue after another and I feel we have got to know one another well. I have a couple of other properties but have never worked with anyone as professional, ethical and reliable. Every property owner should have a Bill, he never admits defeat and takes personal pride in getting things done. David Jones. Luton’</blockquote>
